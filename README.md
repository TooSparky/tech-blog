## Description

As a full-stack developer, I want to be able to post blogs, comment, and view others post's on a single application. This application uses mySQL database, npm packages, and both back-end with sequelize and front-end with handlebars. As my first full-stack application, it was fairly difficult to get up and running.

## Installation

To install this project, simply go to the proper link or type in the URL, since this application will be deployed on Heroku.
